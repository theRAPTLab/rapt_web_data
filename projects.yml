- name: STEP
  full_name: Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP)
  blurb: In the Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP) project, we are investigating how embodied play among elementary school students can be used to help them understand scientific phenomena (e.g., the working of forces, complex behaviors of bees).

- name: Net.Create and VFOI
  blurb: Net.Create is a collaborative network visualization tool developed to help users explore a large corpus of data together, concurrently. This was originally implemented in undergraduate history classrooms, and more recently we have worked with middle school students to explore data literacy.

- name: SEEDS
  full_name: Scaffolding Explanations and Epistemic Development for Systems (SEEDS)
  blurb: In the Scaffolding Explanations and Epistemic Development for Systems (SEEDS) project, we are exploring how elementary students (5th grade) think about different kinds of evidence as important for helping them create and revise models of scientific phenomena. To study this, we developed the Model and Evidence Mapping Environment (MEME).

- name: BeeSign
  blurb: 'BeeSign is a computer simulation designed to help young students observe the behavior of honeybees as they collect nectar and experiment with the result of changing either the behavior of the bees or the environment in which the hive is located. As a research project, BeeSign was designed to help early elementary students (grades k-2) explore complex systems concepts in intuitive ways.'

- name: BioSim
  blurb: 'Our goal in the BioSim project is to help early elementary students (k-2) explore complex systems concepts by engaging in participatory simulations where they take on the role of honeybees (BeeSim) or ants (AntSim) foraging for food. To support students in embodying these roles, they work with electronic puppets that help track their food collection activities and provide real-time feedback to them.'
